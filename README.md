# Food-Choices-and-Preferences-of-College-Students
Analyzing the Food Choices and Preferences of College Students dataset as my first data anlaytics project. 
My aim is to demonstrate the following skills: Data cleaning, organising, transformation, analysis and reporting. 

## The Data
This dataset includes information on food choices, nutrition, preferences, childhood favourites, and other information from college students. There are 126 responses from students. Data is raw and uncleaned.
### Acknowledgements
This dataset was taken from Borapajo from an open kaggel dataset. 

## The Project
### Goals
The questions that i would like to answer from this analysis are as follow:
- What affects the frequency of college students eating out in a week?
- Are kids of parents who cook more likely to make better food choices than others?
- People who exercise regularly are more likely to make better food choices than others?
