Analyzing the Food Choices and Preferences of College Students dataset as my first data anlaytics project. 
My aim is to demonstrate the following skills: Data cleaning, organising, transformation, analysis and reporting. 

## The Data
This dataset includes information on food choices, nutrition, preferences, childhood favourites, and other information from college students. There are 126 responses from students. Data is raw and uncleaned.

## The Project
### Goals
The questions that i would like to answer from this analysis are as follow:
- Question 1: Does exercising regularly affect weight of an individual?
- Question 2: Does factors such as: Employment, Income, and Living on or off campus affect the frequency of eating out for college students?
- Question 3: Does students who exercise regularly more likely to make better food choices?
